  textInformation: I have to be honest, we get into trouble a lot, a lot of times
    our lives are in danger while we are working. So, we have to be resourceful when
    it comes to escaping where anything goes and I'm a smart guy so I know the police
    won't shoot me if I have a baby hostage. The problem is what to do with it afterwards.
