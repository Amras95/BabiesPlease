  textNameBaby: Boris
  textInformation: Boris's family was a very poor family that struggled to survive
    from day to day. Tears ran down my face when they offered me their young son
    as payment to pay off their debts. I did not want to, but my boss is very strict
    and would not allow me to leave without payment. Every time I see this child
    I remember that sad day and I can't stand it anymore.
