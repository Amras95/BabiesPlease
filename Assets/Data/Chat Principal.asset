  - 'Terry Rista: Hijacking you from that stupid game design conference was so easy,
    no one was watching. From what I know about you, you think you can survive here
    just by creating video games. Ha, don''t make me laugh. Your amazing videogames
    won''t save you in our cold and desolate country. If you want your freedom back,
    you are going to have to pay and there is only one way to make honest money in
    the Motherland, child slavery. So go to the store and fill us up with Putincoins
    and maybe we''ll let you go.

    You: Will you let me go if I hand you a Junior
    Solutions key?

    Terry Rista: Ha, you are so funny designer man, now shut
    up and rain us Putincoins before I call my friends.'
  - 'Terry Rista: I see you have settled in and already learned how to make Putincoins.
    I''m very happy for you and hope we can become great friends within the next
    few weeks.

    You: Weeks?

    Terry Rista: Of course, did you think this
    was going to be a one time thing?

    You: I mean, I had that hope.

    Terry
    Rista: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

    You:
    ...

    Terry Rista: Ahhh, video game man why don''t you try getting into comedy,
    you have a lot of future.'
  - 'Terry Rista: Good afternoon Mr. Prisoner, how is life treating you on this wonderful
    day?

    You: Really?

    Terry Rista: Yep yep yep.

    You: I''ve been
    better, thank you.

    Terry Rista: No need to have that long face, today is
    the best day of the week: payday. I don''t understand how anyone can be so grumpy
    on such a beautiful and full of life day like this.

    You: Please take the
    Putincoins and leave, you''re giving me the creeps.'
  - "Terry Rista: So, you were working on a game before all this?\r\nYou: Yes.\r\nTerry
    Rista: And... what was it about? \r\nYou: I can't go around telling that stuff
    to just anyone, it's a secret.\r\nTerry Rista: Please.\r\nYou: No.\r\nTerry Rista:
    Dalee.\r\nYou: Don't insist.\r\nTerry Rista: \u2639"
  - "You: Well, last week, I'm almost done with everything.\r\nTerry Rista: It's
    been an interesting few months.\r\nYou: Peculiar I would say.\r\nTerry Rista:
    But you still have to pay me for the last week. \r\nYou: Yes, I know.\r\nTerry
    Rista: I'm going to miss you... unless you don't pay, if you don't pay you're
    going to see me angry.\r\nYou: Couldn't the good face have lasted a little longer?"
  TextLost: "Terry Rista: You saw my face. I gave you a chance to be able to do something
    great and you blew it. I feel like you spit in my face. I don't like people who
    spit in my face.\r\nYou: I did the best I could. If you give me a few more days
    I could finish paying you back.\r\nTerry Rista: Besides, you take me for a fool.
    No one has ever disrespected me as much as you have. Get ready, we'll be there
    in 15 minutes and I don't know if I can assure your physical well being.\r\nYou:
    ...\r\nTerry Rista: See you.\r"
  TextWin: "Terry Rista: Well, I think this is where our paths diverge. We experienced
    a lot of things together over these 8 weeks. A lot of memories, a lot of stories.
    I'm going to miss you video game man.\r\nYou: Do you even know my name?\r\nTerry
    Rista: What do names matter when a friendship is as strong as this one, when
    it overcomes all barriers? You were a hard worker, but a better friend.\r\nYou:
    ...\r\nTerry Rista: I wouldn't know what to say either. I can imagine the emotions
    you must be experiencing. Your silence says it all.\r\nYou: Well... I'm going
    to go now. Take care of yourself and stop appropriating babies.\r\nTerry Rista:
    Take care you designer man, may your projects lift you higher than the phoenix
    and may you go further than anyone has ever been able to in their lives. \r\nYou:
    Yeah, well. Terry: That. Bye.\r\nTerry Rista: *cry*\r"
