  textInformation: Even people with cheerful appearances can have complicated lives
    and the best example is Pagliacci the clown. He had to sell everything in order
    to keep his little circus going. Poor guy, he was losing money everywhere. One
    day he brought us this baby to pay his debts and we accepted him because his
    jokes have always made us laugh. The weird thing about the little guy is that
    no matter how hard we try, we can't get the clown paint off his face.
