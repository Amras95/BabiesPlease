  textInformation: Last week I was at my favorite drinking spot when a stray bear
    showed up. I had to break my bottle of vodka to confront it. I heard a little
    cry from inside the bear as I was pulling its fur out for a new rug. The little
    guy was good as new inside the bear, you can tell the Motherland only makes strong
    children.
