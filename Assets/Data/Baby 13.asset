  textInformation: 'For my nephew''s 18th birthday I decided to give him something
    he had been asking for a long time. A 0km can be very expensive, but I have a
    friend who sells them used and he gave me a very good price for one especially
    because he wanted to get rid of it. Then on my nephew''s birthday I understood
    why he wanted to sell it so badly, the tank came with a baby in it. '
